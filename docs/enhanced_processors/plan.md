# Enhanced Processors Migration Implementation Plan

## 1. Feature Understanding

The enhanced processors migration involves completing the transition from the deprecated `templates_extensions.py` to the modern `templates/processors/` architecture. Based on analysis, the migration is 95% complete with only minor cleanup and optimization tasks remaining.

### Current State
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Core migration to `templates/processors/` directory
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: All three processors (manga, rename, video) fully implemented
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Validation framework in `templates/processors/base.py`
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: CLI integration and comprehensive test coverage
- ⚠️ **MINOR CLEANUP**: Legacy references and potential optimizations

## 2. Implementation Blueprint

### Phase 1: Legacy Cleanup (Low Risk)
Remove remaining references to deprecated `templates_extensions.py` and update documentation strings.

### Phase 2: Optimization (Medium Risk)
Enhance the validation framework and add advanced features like performance monitoring.

### Step 4: Documentation Update
- **Risk**: Very Low
- **Dependencies**: Steps 1-3 completed
- **Goal**: Comprehensive documentation refresh

### Step 5: Future Extensibility
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: All previous steps
- **Goal**: Framework for custom processors

## 4. LLM Implementation Prompts

### Prompt 1: Legacy Cleanup
```
Clean up legacy references to templates_extensions.py in the Collection Sorter codebase.

Current issue: The file tests/manga/test_manga_sort.py contains an outdated comment on line 11 that references the old templates_extensions location.

Tasks:
1. Update the comment in tests/manga/test_manga_sort.py line 11 to reference the current templates/processors/ location
2. Search for any other deprecated references or comments that mention templates_extensions
3. Ensure all import statements and docstrings reflect the current architecture
4. Update any README or documentation files that might reference the old structure

Requirements:
- Make minimal changes - only update references, don't modify functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility for any existing tests
- Update comments to be accurate and helpful
- Run tests to ensure no functionality is broken

Expected outcome: All references to templates_extensions.py are updated to reference templates/processors/ architecture.
```

### Prompt 2: Validation Framework Enhancement
```
Enhance the validation framework in templates/processors/base.py to add more sophisticated validation capabilities.

Current state: The validation framework has basic validators for paths, extensions, and common parameters.

Tasks:
1. Add ConfigValidator class to validate entire processor configurations
2. Add ValidationChain class to combine multiple validators
3. Add ConditionalValidator for context-dependent validation
4. Add FileSystemValidator for advanced file/directory checks
5. Update existing processors to use enhanced validation where appropriate
6. Add comprehensive error messages with suggestions for fixes

Requirements:
- Follow the existing patterns in base.py
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing validators
- Add proper type hints and documentation
- Include unit tests for all new validators
- Use the Result pattern for error handling

Expected outcome: Enhanced validation framework with chainable validators and better error reporting.
```

### Prompt 3: Performance Monitoring Integration
```
Add performance monitoring capabilities to the processor framework in templates/processors/.

Current state: Processors execute operations but don't track performance metrics.

Tasks:
1. Create ProcessorMetrics class to track execution time, file counts, and error rates
2. Add PerformanceMonitor context manager for timing operations
3. Integrate metrics collection into BaseFileProcessor
4. Add optional performance logging to existing processors
5. Create MetricsReporter for generating performance summaries
6. Add configuration options to enable/disable performance monitoring

Requirements:
- Minimal overhead when monitoring is disabled
- Thread-safe metrics collection
- Integration with existing logging system
- Optional dependency - should work without performance monitoring
- Clear separation between core functionality and monitoring

Expected outcome: Optional performance monitoring integrated into the processor framework.
```

### Prompt 4: Documentation Comprehensive Update
```
Update all documentation to reflect the completed enhanced processors migration and new features.

Current state: Basic documentation exists but needs updating for recent enhancements.

Tasks:
1. Update validation_framework.md with new validation capabilities
2. Create enhanced_processors_guide.md with complete usage examples
3. Update project_structure.md with any new components
4. Add performance monitoring documentation
5. Create migration guide for users upgrading from old processors
6. Update CLI help text and command documentation
7. Add troubleshooting section for common validation errors

Requirements:
- Include practical examples for all features
- Clear, concise writing suitable for developers
- Code examples that can be copy-pasted
- Cross-references between related documentation
- Keep existing documentation structure

Expected outcome: Comprehensive, up-to-date documentation for the enhanced processors system.
```

### Prompt 5: Extensibility Framework
```
Create a framework for users to easily create custom processors using the enhanced validation system.

Current state: Three built-in processors exist but no clear path for custom processors.

Tasks:
1. Create ProcessorTemplate base class with standard workflow
2. Add CustomProcessorFactory for registering new processor types
3. Create ProcessorRegistry for managing custom processors
4. Add plugin system for loading processors from external modules
5. Create example custom processor with full validation
6. Add documentation and tutorial for creating custom processors
7. Update CLI to support custom processor commands

Requirements:
- Follow existing design patterns (Template Method, Factory, Strategy)
- Maintain type safety with generics
- Clear separation between core and custom functionality
- Easy to use API for common processor operations
- Comprehensive examples and documentation

Expected outcome: Framework allowing users to create custom processors that integrate seamlessly with the existing system.
```

## 5. Integration Strategy

Each step builds on the previous one:
- **Step 1** ensures clean foundation
- **Step 2** enhances core validation capabilities
- **Step 3** adds monitoring building on enhanced validation
- **Step 4** documents all new features
- **Step 5** provides extensibility using all previous enhancements

## 6. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Each new component gets comprehensive unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Test new features with existing processors
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure no existing functionality is broken
- **Performance Tests**: Validate monitoring overhead is minimal
- **Documentation Tests**: Ensure all examples work as documented

## 7. Risk Mitigation

- **Low Risk Steps First**: Start with cleanup and documentation
- **Incremental Changes**: Each step is independently valuable
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing APIs
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test each step thoroughly
- **Rollback Plan**: Each step can be reverted independently

## 8. Success Criteria

- All legacy references removed
- Enhanced validation framework operational
- Performance monitoring integrated
- Complete documentation updated
- Extensibility framework functional
- All tests passing
- No regression in existing functionality

## 9. Timeline Estimation

- **Step 1**: 2-4 hours (Legacy cleanup)
- **Step 2**: 8-12 hours (Validation enhancement)
- **Step 3**: 6-10 hours (Performance monitoring)
- **Step 4**: 4-8 hours (Documentation update)
- **Step 5**: 12-16 hours (Extensibility framework)

**Total**: 32-50 hours of development time

## 10. Post-Implementation

- Monitor performance impact of new features
- Gather user feedback on validation error messages
- Consider additional processor types based on usage patterns
- Plan for future enhancements based on community needs
