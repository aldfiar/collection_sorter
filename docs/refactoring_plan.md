# File Management Code Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to refactor the file management components of the Collection Sorter project, applying modern design patterns and principles to improve maintainability, flexibility, and testability.

## Patterns and Principles to Implement

### 1. Composition Over Inheritance

**Current Issue**: The project uses inheritance extensively (e.g., `ArchivedCollection` extends `CollectionPath`, `MovableCollection` extends `CollectionPath`).

**Improvement**: Replace inheritance hierarchies with composition for more flexible code structure.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create specialized component classes for file operations
- Update `CollectionPath` to use these components
- Replace inheritance with delegation

### 2. Strategy Pattern for File Operations

**Current Issue**: Different strategies (move, rename, archive) are implemented in separate classes with duplicated logic.

**Improvement**: Encapsulate various file operations as interchangeable strategy objects.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create a `FileOperationStrategy` interface
- Implement concrete strategies for each operation type (move, copy, archive)
- Update file processors to accept and use these strategies

### 3. Command Pattern for Multi-step Operations

**Current Issue**: Multi-step file operations (e.g., archive and then move) are tightly coupled.

**Improvement**: Encapsulate operations as command objects that can be executed, combined, and potentially undone.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create a `FileCommand` interface with execute/undo methods
- Implement command classes for each operation
- Create a command executor for running operations

### 4. Dependency Injection

**Current Issue**: Components create their dependencies internally, making testing difficult.

**Improvement**: Inject dependencies instead of creating them internally.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Update constructors to accept dependencies
- Provide sensible defaults for backward compatibility
- Create a simple service locator or factory for complex cases

### 5. Factory Method Pattern for File Handling

**Current Issue**: Direct instantiation of file handling classes throughout the code.

**Improvement**: Use factory methods to create appropriate handlers.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create factory classes for file processors
- Update code to use factories instead of direct instantiation
- Add configuration options to factories

### 6. Decorator Pattern for Enhanced Functionality

**Current Issue**: New functionality requires modifying existing classes.

**Improvement**: Use decorators to add behavior without modifying existing classes.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create decorator base class for file handlers
- Implement decorators for logging, progress tracking, etc.
- Update code to use decorated handlers

### 7. Observer Pattern for Progress Tracking

**Current Issue**: Progress reporting is tightly coupled with file operations.

**Improvement**: Use observers to decouple progress reporting from file operations.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create observable interfaces for file processors
- Implement observer for progress tracking
- Update UI components to observe file operations

### 8. Template Method Pattern for File Processing

**Current Issue**: Similar file processing logic duplicated across classes.

**Improvement**: Use template methods to define skeleton algorithms with customizable steps.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create abstract base classes with template methods
- Extract common logic into template methods
- Implement specific steps in subclasses

### 9. Builder Pattern for Complex File Operations

**Current Issue**: Complex file operations with many options are difficult to configure.

**Improvement**: Use builder pattern for clearer construction of complex operations.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create builder classes for complex operations
- Implement fluent interface for configuration
- Update client code to use builders

### 10. Result/Either Pattern for Error Handling

**Current Issue**: Error handling relies heavily on exceptions.

**Improvement**: Use Result pattern for more functional error handling.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create Result class hierarchy
- Update operations to return Result objects
- Update client code to handle Results

### 11. Value Objects for File Paths

**Current Issue**: Path handling is inconsistent (sometimes strings, sometimes Path objects).

**Improvement**: Use value objects to encapsulate paths with validation.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create FilePath value object
- Update code to use FilePath consistently
- Add validation and helper methods

### 12. Chain of Responsibility for File Processing Steps

**Current Issue**: File processing pipelines have hard-coded steps.

**Improvement**: Use chain of responsibility to create flexible pipelines.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Create processor interface with chain support
- Implement processor chain for file operations
- Update client code to build and use processor chains

## Implementation Order

We'll implement these improvements in the following order, prioritizing the most impactful changes first:

1. Value Objects for File Paths
2. Dependency Injection
3. Composition Over Inheritance
4. Strategy Pattern for File Operations
5. Result/Either Pattern for Error Handling
6. Factory Method Pattern
7. Template Method Pattern
8. Command Pattern
9. Builder Pattern
10. Decorator Pattern
11. Observer Pattern
12. Chain of Responsibility

## Success Criteria

The refactoring will be considered successful when:

- Code duplication is significantly reduced
- New file operation types can be added without modifying existing code
- Unit tests can be written without complex mocking
- Error handling is consistent and more informative
- File operations have a consistent API
- The codebase is more maintainable and extensible
