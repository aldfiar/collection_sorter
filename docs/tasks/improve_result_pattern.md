# Task: Improve Result Pattern Implementation

## Goal
Enhance and fix the Result pattern implementation to ensure consistent error handling throughout the codebase, addressing any issues in the current implementation and ensuring all tests pass.

## Final Result
- All result-related tests should pass
- Consistent error handling across the codebase
- Proper usage of the Result pattern in all command handlers and processors
- Clear and informative error messages

## Files to Change
- `collection_sorter/result/result.py`
- `collection_sorter/result/result_processor.py`
- `collection_sorter/result/result_strategies.py`
- `tests/test_result_pattern.py`

## Context
The Result pattern is a key part of error handling in the codebase, providing a functional approach to error handling without relying heavily on exceptions. Some tests are failing, indicating issues with the implementation:

1. Failures in the result pattern tests:
```
FAILED tests/test_result_pattern.py::TestResultPattern::test_file_operations
FAILED tests/test_result_pattern.py::TestResultPattern::test_result_processor
```

2. The Result pattern implementation is in `collection_sorter/result/result.py`:
```python
class Result(Generic[T, E], ABC):
    """
    Base class for the Result pattern.
    
    This represents either a successful operation with a value of type T,
    or a failed operation with an error of type E.
    """
    # Check methods and error handling
```

3. Important aspects to verify:
   - Correct handling of unwrap/error methods
   - Proper implementation of error chaining
   - Consistent approach to error creation
   - Integration with OperationError for file operations
   - Support for error collection in batch operations

4. Pattern to follow:
   - Review how the ZipCommandHandler and other working components use the Result pattern
   - Ensure consistent mapping of exceptions to appropriate error types
   - Verify error aggregation for batch operations
   - Check that error details are properly preserved

The Result pattern is critical for maintaining consistent error handling throughout the application, especially as it transitions from exception-based to more functional error handling approaches.
