# Task: Update Video Processing Components

## Goal
Update the video processing components to fully implement the template method pattern, ensuring consistent use of the `VideoCommandHandler` and the Result pattern for error handling, while providing appropriate backward compatibility for testing.

## Final Result
- All video-related tests should pass
- Consistent use of `VideoCommandHandler` with the template method pattern
- Proper inheritance from base classes with correct constructor parameters
- Compatibility layer for legacy code if needed
- Consistent error handling using the Result pattern

## Files to Change
- `collection_sorter/cli_handlers/video_handler.py`
- `tests/test_video_processor.py`
- Any related video processing components

## Context
The video processing components appear to need updates similar to the manga and zip components, transitioning from older procedural code to the modern template method pattern.

1. The failing tests in `test_video_processor.py` suggest issues with the current implementation:
```
FAILED tests/test_video_processor.py::TestVideoProcessor::test_different_formats
FAILED tests/test_video_processor.py::TestVideoProcessor::test_handler_video_processor
FAILED tests/test_video_processor.py::TestVideoProcessor::test_template_video_processor
```

2. The video handler may have similar inheritance or constructor issues to those found in other handlers:
```python
# Potential issue in VideoCommandHandler constructor
def __init__(
    self,
    sources: List[str],
    destination: Optional[str] = None,
    # Other parameters...
):
    # Check if super().__init__() has the correct parameters
    super().__init__()  # May be missing required parameters
```

3. Pattern to follow:
   - Use the `ZipCommandHandler` as a reference implementation
   - Ensure proper inheritance from base classes with correct constructor parameters
   - Implement the template method pattern for video processing
   - Use the Result pattern for error handling
   - Update tests to work with the new implementation

The video processing components should follow a similar approach to what was done with the ZIP functionality, implementing the template method pattern and Result pattern consistently.
